# Demo airline service

This is a quick demo of how a super simple service can be built to interact between Zenter and an Airline.

Note: This is meant as proof of concept but not as actually fully functional code. 

## Example setup

 - Setup a webserver to route all calls to the `index.php` file in the `Public` folder with the `Public` folder as the webserver root

## Example usage

 - Call the webserver with using either [/delay](/delay) or [/landed](/landed).
